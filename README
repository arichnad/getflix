 getflix.pl and Netflix.pm have are based on scripts by John Ressig
 of http://ejohn.org. Thanks John!

KEEP IN MIND: I AM NOT A GREAT PERL PROGRAMMER!
There must be better ways to do what I've done; but the method I've used works.
If you think my way is wrong, let me know and I will work on it. Send me a specific 
info, and I'll work on it faster! Tell me I suck, and I will work on it... never.

Included files:
- getflix.pl
- Netflix.pm
- nflixHisto.py
- getdirectors.py
- getstars.py
- dirHisto.py

PREPARATION:
- Tested with Perl 5.8.6
- Tested with Python 2.3
- Perl modules: WWW::Mechanize, Crypt::SSLeay, and Data::Dumper

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Extract all the scripts by typing 'tar -zxf getFlix.tar.gz' at command line.
- Type 'cd getFlix' at command line.
- Edit your email address and password in the getflix.pl script.
- Edit the path to perl (the first line) to match yours in each .pl script.
- Edit the path to python to match yours in each .py script.
